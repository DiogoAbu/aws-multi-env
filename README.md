## üöÄ Introduction

When deploy to AWS you might want to have different configurations files per environment, and this package does just that.

It finds files prepended with an environment key and renames to proper naming, and remove others.

Example for deploy on `prod`:
```
Renamed: ./.ebextensions/prod-migration.config => ./.ebextensions/migration.config
Removed: ./.ebextensions/staging-certbot.config
```

And then when build is finished:
```
Renamed: ./.ebextensions/migration.config => ./.ebextensions/prod-migration.config
Restored: ./.ebextensions/staging-certbot.config
```

## üîß Installation

There's no need to install [aws-multi-env](https://github.com/DiogoAbu/aws-multi-env), you can use it with [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx).

## üìñ Usage

Use locally:
```sh
npx aws-multi-env --env "env-name" --buildCmd "yarn build-and-zip" --deployCmd "eb deploy"
```

Use on CI to just build, zip and deploy using an action like [beanstalk-deploy](https://github.com/einaregilsson/beanstalk-deploy).
```yml
- name: Prepare deploy
  run: |
    npx aws-multi-env --env "${{ secrets.AWS_ENVIRONMENT_NAME }}" --buildCmd "yarn build && zip -r deploy.zip folders to zip" --skipDeploy
```

## 🚀 Introduction

When deploying to AWS you might want to have different configurations files per environment, and this package does just that.

It finds files that match an environment key and renames to proper naming, remove files from other environments and keep the ones without especific env.

## 🔧 Installation

There's no need to install [aws-multi-env](https://github.com/DiogoAbu/aws-multi-env), you can use it with [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx).

## 📖 Usage

To run any command the working tree on the source folders must be clean.

```sh
npx aws-multi-env [command] <options>
```

Preparing files for deployment with an application name `app-server-prod`:
```sh
$ npx aws-multi-env prepare --env app-server-prod
» i  Current environment: prod
» i  Renaming files from "prod" to correct name, and removing other files
» i    Removed: ./.ebextensions/certbot.staging.config
» i    Keep: ./.ebextensions/migration.config
» i    Removed: ./.ebextensions/ssl.staging.config
» i    Removed: ./.platform/nginx/conf.d/https_custom.staging.conf
» √  Environment ready, files were renamed and/or removed
```

Then, after you build/deploy you can revert the changes to deploy on another environment:
```sh
$ npx aws-multi-env revert --env app-server-prod
» i  Current environment: prod
» i  Renaming files back and restoring removed files
» i    Running: git clean ./.ebextensions/** ./.platform/**
» i    Running: git checkout ./.ebextensions/** ./.platform/**
» √  Environment restored, files renamed back and/or restored
```

Use on CI:
```yml
- name: Prepare deploy staging
  run: |
    npx aws-multi-env prepare --env "${{ secrets.AWS_ENVIRONMENT_NAME_STAGING }}"
    yarn build && zip -r "$RUNNER_TEMP/deploy-staging.zip" .
    npx aws-multi-env revert --env "${{ secrets.AWS_ENVIRONMENT_NAME_STAGING }}"

- name: Prepare deploy prod
  run: |
    npx aws-multi-env prepare --env "${{ secrets.AWS_ENVIRONMENT_NAME_PROD }}"
    yarn build && zip -r "$RUNNER_TEMP/deploy-prod.zip" .
    npx aws-multi-env revert --env "${{ secrets.AWS_ENVIRONMENT_NAME_PROD }}"
```

## üöÄ Introduction

When deploy to AWS you might want to have different configurations files per environment, and this package does just that.

It finds files prepended with an environment key and renames to proper naming, remove files from other environments and keep the ones without especific env.

It uses the regex `/.+[.][a-z]+\..+$/`, so it matches files like this `file.prod.config`, `file.staging.config`, but not `file.config`.

Example for deploy on `prod`:
```
üìÅ Renaming files from "prod" to correct name, and removing other files
      Renamed: ./.ebextensions/file.prod.config => ./.ebextensions/file.config
      Removed: ./.ebextensions/other.staging.config
      Keep: ./.ebextensions/www.config
```

And then when build is finished:
```
üìÅ Renaming files back to "prod", and restoring removed files
      Renamed: ./.ebextensions/file.config => ./.ebextensions/file.prod.config
      Restored: ./.ebextensions/other.staging.config
```

## üîß Installation

There's no need to install [aws-multi-env](https://github.com/DiogoAbu/aws-multi-env), you can use it with [npx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx).

## üìñ Usage

Use locally:
```sh
npx aws-multi-env --env "env-name" --buildCmd "yarn build-and-zip" --deployCmd "eb deploy"
```

Use on CI to just build, zip and deploy using an action like [beanstalk-deploy](https://github.com/einaregilsson/beanstalk-deploy).
```yml
- name: Prepare deploy
  run: |
    npx aws-multi-env --env "${{ secrets.AWS_ENVIRONMENT_NAME }}" --buildCmd "yarn build && zip -r deploy.zip folders to zip" --skipDeploy
```
